# Motorola-Academy-Game
The Hangman Game

Hello,

At the beginning I would like to thank you for inviting me to the academy.

Also I would to like to highlight 2 things :
1)	In point 7 you wrote : „Your program should read that file at the beginning and randomly select one country-capital pair”.
According to this I created 2 projects :  FirstGame : task 1 - 5 and SecondGame task : 7 to 11.

2)	In SecondGame Project we have 3 string Verable with a path to file :
- string pathToHighScore = @"C:\Git\Motorola-Academy-Game\SecondGame\score.txt";
-string pathToSaveScore = @"C:\Git\Motorola-Academy-Game\SecondGame\score.txt";
-string filePath = @"C:\Git\Motorola-Academy-Game\SecondGame\countries_and_capitals.txt"; (this one have double extension a.txt I removed one)

Please change this path after unzipping the file in your local drive.  

Answering to your question, why I would like to participate in Academy C#. Almost 1 year ago I started programing in the Python language how to automatize several processes
at my current workplace. In the meantime I participated in Nokia C++ Academy in order to learn how to improve memory management. 
Right now in my spare time I am very interested in the topics of Unity Engine and C#. I am convinced that this Academy will let me develop my skills and eventually
change my career path.

Thank you and best regards,
Michal
